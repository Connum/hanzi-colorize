This folder contains work in progress files (raw hanzi files or otherwise not yet finished hanzi), so that contributors don't start to work on the same characters.

Raw files (that is files created from the template.svg and saved from the SVG editor of choice, but not yet converted to the final format via format.html) should be marked with the extension .raw.svg

If you only want to contribute the stroke order for this char without the grouping/radical information, that's totally fine! Just save it in this folder with .raw.svg as the extension, e.g. *09547.raw.svg*, then add it to the following list, so others know that this character is not currently being worked on and available for others to do the grouping.

# Files with finished stroke order, available to contributors for adding the radical meta information:
- currently all in here
